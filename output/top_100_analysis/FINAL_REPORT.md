## 1. Preliminary Analysis

### 1.1 Frequency Distribution

The top 100 words show the following frequency distribution:

| Frequency Range | Count | Percentage |
|----------------|-------|------------|
| Very High (>100) | 3 | 3% |
| High (50-100) | 5 | 5% |
| Medium (20-49) | 11 | 11% |
| Low (10-19) | 43 | 43% |
| Very Low (<10) | 38 | 38% |

### 1.2 Word Length Distribution

| Length (chars) | Word Count |
|---------------|------------|
| 1 | 9 |
| 2 | 1 |
| 3 | 1 |
| 4 | 68 |
| 5 | 19 |
| 6 | 2 |


### 1.3 Character Analysis

- **Total Unique Characters:** 51
- **Most Common Characters:** `$`, `=`, `o`, `Q`, `P`, `>`, `F`, `H`, `C`, `I`

## 2. Morphemic Analysis Results

### 2.1 Statistical Validation

The morphemic analysis reveals statistically significant patterns in the text:

- **Chi-Square Test:** χ² = 2175.3282
- **P-Value:** p = 0.000000
- **Significance Level:** α = 0.05
- **Result:** Reject null hypothesis - Non-random distribution

This confirms that the morpheme distribution
is significantly different from a random distribution.

### 2.2 Morpheme Inventory

- **Total Morphemes Identified:** 157
- **Average Confidence:** 0.00%
- **Verified Words:** 0

## 4. Interpretation and Conclusions

### 4.1 Linguistic Patterns

The analysis reveals several interesting patterns:

1. **Highly Structured Distribution:** The chi-square test shows strong statistical significance,
   indicating that the morpheme distribution is non-random and follows specific patterns.

2. **Character Variety:** The presence of {char_patterns.get('total_unique_chars', 0)} unique characters
   suggests a complex writing system with distinct glyph types.

3. **Frequency Hierarchy:** The words show a clear frequency hierarchy, with a small number of
   very frequent words and a larger number of less frequent words (Zipf's law pattern).

### 4.2 Research Implications

These findings contribute to our understanding of the Voynich Manuscript's linguistic structure:

- The statistically significant morpheme patterns suggest systematic language use
- The character diversity indicates a sophisticated notation system
- The frequency distribution aligns with natural language patterns

### 4.3 Limitations

- Analysis based on transcription conventions (EVA alphabet)
- Morpheme boundaries determined algorithmically without semantic verification
- No predefined morpheme inventory available for this analysis
