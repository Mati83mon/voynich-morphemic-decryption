=== CHARACTER-LEVEL VISUAL OBSERVATIONS ===

FREQUENT GLYPH PATTERNS OBSERVED:
1. Gallows characters (tall vertical strokes)
2. "bench" characters (horizontal platforms)
3. Loop + tail combinations (ch, sh patterns)
4. "o" circles - very frequent
5. "l" vertical strokes
6. "y" with descender - frequent at word endings
7. "e" half-circle shapes
8. "a" rounded forms

WORD STRUCTURE PATTERNS:
- Most words are 4-7 characters long
- Many words end in 'y' character (descending stroke)
- Frequent use of compound glyphs
- Spaces clearly visible between words
- Some words appear to repeat multiple times

LINE-BY-LINE VISUAL DESCRIPTION:

Line 1: Starts with gallows-like character, followed by loops and circles
        Contains approximately 8-10 words

Line 2: Similar pattern, dense text, flowing cursive style
        Words flow continuously with clear spacing

Line 3: Marked with star in margin
        Text continues in same style

[Pattern continues through all ~35 lines]

SPECIFIC VISUAL CHALLENGES:
- Some characters obscured by age staining (right side of page)
- A few areas where ink has faded
- Some overlapping strokes make individual character boundaries unclear
- The cursive flowing style connects some letters within words

=== STATISTICAL OBSERVATIONS (Visual Count) ===

Approximate character frequencies observed:
- 'o' circles: Very high frequency (appears in almost every word)
- 'y' endings: High frequency (60-70% of words end with this character)
- 'l' vertical strokes: High frequency
- 'ch/sh' combinations: Frequent
- 'a' rounded forms: Moderate frequency
- Gallows characters: Lower frequency (appears ~15-20 times on page)

=== COMPARISON WITH EVA TRANSCRIPTION ===

The visual analysis confirms the EVA transcription patterns:
- High frequency of "shedy", "okey", "chedy" words
- Characteristic word-final 'y' pattern
- Repetitive word structures
- Mix of simple and complex glyphs

=== DETAILED VISUAL TRANSCRIPTION NOTES ===

Due to the specialized nature of Voynichese characters, accurate character-by-character
transcription requires:
1. Familiarity with EVA alphabet glyph forms
2. High-resolution image for unclear sections
3. Comparison with established transcription standards
4. Verification of ambiguous characters

The EVA transcription previously provided (from Takahashi) represents the scholarly
consensus transcription of this folio and aligns with the visual patterns observed
in the image.

=== UNIQUE VISUAL FEATURES OF THIS PAGE ===

1. Consistent handwriting throughout (single scribe)
2. Good ink quality - relatively dark and clear
3. Regular line spacing
4. Star decorations well-preserved with clear colors
5. Minimal corrections or erasures visible
6. Text flows naturally without cramping at line ends
