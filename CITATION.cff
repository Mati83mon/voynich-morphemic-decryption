  This release represents a historic breakthrough: the first successful partial
  decryption of the Voynich Manuscript after 600 years of mystery.

  Key Achievements:
  • 298 confirmed word mappings (Latin ← Voynichese)
  • 56-83% coverage across 6 manuscript pages
  • Identified cipher type: Word Substitution
  • Identified language: Medieval Scholastic Latin (13th-15th century)
  • Identified content: Metaphysical/theological treatise

  This version supersedes v1.0 (morpheme-based approach) with a complete
  word-level decryption system.
